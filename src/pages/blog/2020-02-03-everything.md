## What is Geocoding?

**Geocoding** is the process of converting addresses (like "1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA") into geographic coordinates (like latitude 37.423021 and longitude -122.083739), which you can use to place markers on a map, or position the map.

**[Reverse geocoding](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/intro#ReverseGeocoding)** is the process of converting geographic coordinates into a human-readable address.

You can also use the Geocoding API to find the address for a given [place ID](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/intro#place-id).

The Geocoding API provides a direct way to access these services via an HTTP request.

```
import * as _ from 'lodash;

console.log('getting started guide');
function helloName() {
   console.log('hello ' + (name? name : 'World'));
}

helloName();
```
